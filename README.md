# Data Based Inventory System with an Editor
This repository contains the finished version of the inventory system tutorial, as well as the PDF which contains the instructions on how the inventory system is built. It is recommended to download the entire repository and try out the test scene found in *res://scenes/test/inventory_test.tscn*, before starting to get a better understanding of how the system works. In addition it would be useful to view the source files on the side, because not all the code was pasted inside the PDF.
